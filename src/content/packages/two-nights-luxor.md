## The World's Greatest Open-Air Museum

Luxor, ancient Thebes, was once the capital of the world's greatest civilization. This 2-night package immerses you in the heart of ancient Egypt's most spectacular monuments.

### Valley of the Kings

Walk in the footsteps of pharaohs as you descend into elaborately decorated royal tombs, including the famous tomb of Tutankhamun. The valley contains 63 tombs, each more magnificent than the last.

### Karnak Temple

The largest religious complex ever built, Karnak took over 2,000 years to complete. The Hypostyle Hall with its 134 massive columns is one of the most impressive structures in all of Egypt.
